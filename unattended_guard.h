// Unattended-operation guard: shared by the firmware sketch and the native
// regression tests, so the rules are exercised without a radio.
//
// Division of authority (see docs/js8call-neobsluhovany-provoz-plan.md):
//
//   Liveness is the firmware's HARD gate. A frontend that has not been heard
//   from cannot start a new transmission, attended or not. This is unspoofable
//   in the direction that matters: a dead or frozen browser cannot fake it.
//   A transmission already in flight is deliberately NOT aborted here -- three
//   existing paths already cover it (buffer underrun, per-transmission
//   deadline, WebSocket close) and a fourth would kill a legitimate long file
//   transfer on a brief Wi-Fi stall.
//
//   Arming is authoritative STATE, not a hard gate. The firmware owns it so it
//   survives a page reload and can be inspected and revoked from any device on
//   the network; the browser is what stops generating automatic traffic when it
//   lapses. The firmware additionally refuses any tx.prepare the browser itself
//   marked as unattended once arming is gone -- cooperative defence that costs
//   nothing, with no illusion that it constrains a misbehaving browser.
//
//   Operator-initiated transmissions never require arming, otherwise ordinary
//   manual operating would break.
//
// All deadlines use millis(); comparisons are wrap-safe via signed differences,
// matching the rest of the sketch. The longest arming window is 168 h, well
// inside the ~49.7 day millis() wrap.
