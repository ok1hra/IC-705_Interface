// The calibration plan: which band × power cells to measure, in what order, and
// what has to happen between them. See docs/tx-audio-gain-plan-implementace.md.
//
// This file decides; it never acts. It owns no DOM, no clock and no fetch, and it
// answers exactly one question at a time -- "what next?" -- with an intent the
// host executes. Three reasons that shape, all of them learned the hard way in
// this repo:
//
//  * The alternative is `for (const cell of plan) { await retune(); await ask();
//    await measure(); }`, which reads better and cannot be tested outside a
//    browser. Every await in that chain is a place where STOP, a lost session, a
//    dropped LAN link and a hidden tab all have to be handled, and an abort
//    leaves the rest of the chain dangling. Here an abort is one transition.
//  * A page in a background tab has its timers throttled, so anything that paced
//    itself would stall exactly where a transmission does not.
//  * The plan keys a transmitter on bands the operator did not choose by hand. The
//    ordering rules -- ascending power inside a band, one antenna question per
//    retune, survey before the MOD level write -- are safety rules, and safety
//    rules belong somewhere they can be asserted without a radio.
