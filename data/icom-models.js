// What this interface knows about each Icom transceiver, in one table.
//
// There used to be two half-tables: RADIO_FULL_POWER_W in wspr-core.js (watts
// only) and a single hand-written IC-705 procedure in data.html. Both answered
// "which radio is this?" and they could not both be right for five models, so an
// IC-7760 could not transmit WSPR at all (no watts entry -> refuse) while the
// setup help confidently explained an IC-705 menu tree to its operator.
//
// Keyed on the model NUMBER, not the reported string. The number is what the
// radio is; everything around it drifts. "IC-705", "IC705", a trailing firmware
// revision -- all parse to 705.
//
// DOM-free on purpose: wspr-core.js requires this under Node in the smoke tools,
// and trx-help.js builds the setup guides from the same rows in the browser.

  // net:      the word this radio uses for the network audio path. The IC-705 is
  //           wireless and says WLAN; every Ethernet model says LAN. It appears in
  //           three menu items, so it is data rather than three separate strings.
  // netMenu:  where Network Control and the credentials live. THREE variants, not
  //           two: the IC-705 keeps them under WLAN Set, the IC-7300MK2 and
  //           IC-7760 under Network > Remote Settings, and the IC-7610 and IC-9700
  //           have no Remote Settings submenu at all -- the items sit directly
  //           under Network. Verified in each radio's own manual, in docs/.
  // hasPreset: PRESET stores a whole named combination of settings, so the
  //           operator gets one-touch return to a working digital setup. Only some
  //           radios have it; on the others the guide has to say "set these by
  //           hand" rather than silently dropping three steps.
  // watts:    full output at 100 % of the CI-V power scale. This is the number
  //           that makes WSPR's dBm honest, and getting it wrong is a
  //           factor-of-ten error, so an unknown radio deliberately has no row.
  // civAddr:  the radio's default CI-V address. Note the IC-7300MK2 is B6h, NOT
  //           the original IC-7300's 94h -- same number, different address.
  //
  // modLevelCmd / modInputCmd: the 1A 05 subaddresses for this radio's network
  //           MOD level and for the setting that says which input feeds the
  //           modulator in a data mode. PRESENT ONLY WHERE THE NUMBER WAS READ IN
  //           THIS MODEL'S OWN CI-V REFERENCE, and absent everywhere else, because
  //           there is nothing to check a guess against: across models the
  //           subaddresses are 00 62, 00 83, 00 90, 01 14, 01 17, 01 25 and 01 28,
  //           with no pattern at all. The cost of guessing is not a failed write --
  //           1A 05 01 14 is the LAN MOD level on one model and "WLAN AF/IF Output
  //           select" on another, and 01 31 is CI-V Transceive, which would take
  //           the radio away mid-run with the restore still unsent.
  //
  //           A model with no number here is not left stranded: the tool reads the
  //           address first and only writes what the radio confirmed, and where it
  //           cannot, `modMenu` is what the operator is told to set by hand.
