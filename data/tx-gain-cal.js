// TX gain calibration: find the highest audio level the radio takes without
// its ALC acting. See docs/tx-auto-gain-implementace.md.
//
// The whole file is deliberately clock-free. Two independent reasons:
//
//  * The audio the browser writes reaches the radio a ring-depth later, so
//    "wait 500 ms and read the meter" measures the PREVIOUS level. What the
//    firmware does report is `consumed` -- how many mu-law bytes the radio has
//    actually played -- and that is an exact answer to "is the radio at the new
//    level yet". Every step here is therefore gated on bytes, not on time.
//  * A page in a background tab has its timers throttled to once a second or
//    worse, while WebSocket frames keep arriving. Anything clocked on timers
//    would stall exactly where the transmission does not.
//
// The other trap this encodes: a repeated ALC reading is not a new observation.
// The firmware only bumps `alcSeq` when the radio actually answered 15 13, so a
// sample counts once. Without that, one deflection would be read as several and
// the search would walk down past the knee it just found.
