// One calibration tool, hosted by two pages.
//
// The search itself is tx-gain-cal.js. This is everything around it: the carrier,
// the byte accounting, the panel, the verdict and the write into the station's
// table. It lives here because the WSPR page and the JS8Call page must run the
// SAME tool -- the measurement is a property of the radio, not of the mode, and
// two copies of a transmitter-keying panel would be "similar" within a month.
//
// Like lan-gate.js and wake-lock.js this carries its own markup and CSS, so
// putting the tool on a page is one script tag and one create() call.
//
// The carrier is deliberately NOT either page's own tune path. It is a WsprStream
// single tone driven by WsprTx, for one reason: the search has to move the level
// eight or nine times inside one keying, and only that pair generates audio a
// packet at a time. The JS8 page's tune carrier is pre-rendered into one buffer,
// so its level is fixed the moment it is built -- which is why the tool could not
// simply be "the tune button with a loop around it".
//
// Everything a page must supply is in the adapter. Nothing in here reads a global.
